Replicate the following wireframe layout. Remember, each component holds its own content, so each component should have its own styling.

Wireframe displayed three components as children of the AppComponent: Alpha, Beta, & Gamma.

Alpha & Beta are siblings, displayed next to each other.
Gamma is child of, and displayed within, Beta.

All components are displayed within a border.
