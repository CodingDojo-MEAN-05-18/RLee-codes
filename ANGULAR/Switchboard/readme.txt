Switchboard
Create a row of switches. Upon clicking any one of the switches, change the switch from 'ON' text
with a green background, to 'OFF' text and red background. 

When we click each indicidual button, the button should toggle from ON(green) to OFF(red).
The initial order of on/off position is not relevant.
Create a row of 10 buttons.
    **For practice, a form element was added which allows the user to select the number of switches.
